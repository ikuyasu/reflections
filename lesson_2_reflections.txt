- What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the repository which you can use Git to track files in the directory (folder) but
files have to be specified to track. If you don't create a repository, then you cannnot really
use Git to track files or anything.

- How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I don't think the lesson has not talked about the benefit of having a staging area (yet?). As far as I understand, a group of files (logically associated) can be togethter moved to the staging area so that those files can be only committed leaving a logically separated file intact. I am not really observing the true benefit of it.
